Here's are the things that I figured out I need to look into and improve:

.Game Economy

.Cap Range

.Card Abilities
  .The Ace Card Abilities are triggered if certain conditions are met and directly affect the points added to aggregate at end of turn

.Scheduling Tournament
  .I need to maximize participants (and by extension, number of matches) while dealing with time constraints
  .May ditch this later beacuse it doesnt really fit into the overall project or have direct bearing on the game.
